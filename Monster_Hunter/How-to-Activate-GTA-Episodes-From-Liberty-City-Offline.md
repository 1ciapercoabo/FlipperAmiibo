## What is GTA: Episodes From Liberty City?
 
GTA: Episodes From Liberty City is a compilation of two downloadable content (DLC) episodes for GTA IV: The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony. The game was released in 2009 for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC. Unlike previous GTA games, GTA: Episodes From Liberty City does not require the original GTA IV to play, as it is a standalone product. However, it does use the same game engine and graphics as GTA IV, and it is set in the same fictional city of Liberty City.
 
## What is Manual Activation and Offline Date Check?
 
Manual Activation and Offline Date Check are two processes that are required to play GTA: Episodes From Liberty City offline on PC. Manual Activation is a way of verifying that you have a legitimate copy of the game by entering a serial number and an unlock code. Offline Date Check is a way of ensuring that your PC's date is correct by comparing it with a reference date file. Both processes are done using SecuROM, a digital rights management (DRM) system that protects the game from piracy.
 
## How to Perform Manual Activation?
 
To perform Manual Activation, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Launch GTA: Episodes From Liberty City on your PC.
2. When prompted, enter the serial number that came with your copy of the game.
3. Click on "Activate Manually".
4. A new window will open with an unlock request code. Copy this code or write it down.
5. Go to another PC that has an internet connection and visit [this website](https://support.securom.com/rockstarunlock/GTA_EFLC/index.php?c=unlock).
6. Enter your serial number and unlock request code in the corresponding fields.
7. Click on "Generate Unlock Code".
8. A new window will open with an unlock code. Copy this code or write it down.
9. Go back to your PC where you installed the game and enter the unlock code in the activation window.
10. Click on "Activate".
11. Your game should be activated and ready to play.

## How to Perform Offline Date Check?
 
To perform Offline Date Check, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Go to another PC that has an internet connection and visit [this website](https://support.securom.com/rockstarunlock/GTA_EFLC/index.php?c=datecheck).
2. Enter your serial number in the field provided.
3. Click on "Generate Reference Date File".
4. A new window will open with a link to download a file named "GTA\_EFLC\_DateCheck.zip". Download this file and save it on a USB drive or any other removable media.
5. Go back to your PC where you installed the game and unzip the file "GTA\_EFLC\_DateCheck.zip" in the same folder where the game is installed (usually C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\EFLC).
6. Launch GTA: Episodes From Liberty City on your PC.
7. The game will automatically detect the reference date file and compare it with your PC's date.
8. If your PC's date is within 30 days of the reference date file, your game should start normally.
9. If your PC's date is more than 30 days away from the reference date file, you will need to generate a new reference date file using the same steps as before.
