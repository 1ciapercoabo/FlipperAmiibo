In this article, I will also give you some tips and tricks on how to play The Commission: Organized Crime Grand Strategy effectively. The game can be quite challenging and complex, so you might need some guidance to succeed in your criminal endeavors.
 
First of all, you need to choose your family wisely. Each family has its own unique perks and abilities, as well as different starting locations and rivals. For example, the Morello family has a bonus to racketeering and gambling, but also has a higher police attention. The Donnelly family has a bonus to smuggling and bootlegging, but also has a lower loyalty. You should pick a family that suits your playstyle and strategy.
 
Secondly, you need to manage your territory and resources carefully. You can expand your territory by taking over rackets, businesses, and neighborhoods from other factions. You can also upgrade your rackets and businesses to increase your income and influence. However, you also need to pay attention to your expenses, such as bribes, wages, and upkeep. You also need to balance your relations with other factions, such as allies, rivals, and the police. You can use diplomacy, intimidation, or violence to deal with them.
 
Thirdly, you need to plan your actions wisely. You have a limited number of action points per turn, which you can use to perform various actions, such as moving your units, attacking enemies, hiring associates, or researching new perks. You should prioritize the actions that are most beneficial for your goals and situation. You should also be prepared for the consequences of your actions, such as retaliation from enemies or increased attention from the authorities.
